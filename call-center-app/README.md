# Intro

This project simulates a call center app.  The goal is to show the 
consumption of the cloud provider's resources that Astra based applications
would consume.

## How is this different than using Dynamodb, BigTable, Cosmos
Good question.  It's not.

The question is focused on other DBs can also show demand for the 
cloud provider's services.  That is true and this demo doesn't create
an advantage that DataStax can express....when presented independently
of the Astra narrative around zero lock-in, freedom of choice, massive
scale, etc.
