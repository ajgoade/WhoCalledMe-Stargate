# UploadWAV

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.7.

The intent is to authorize a user and then allow them access to the page where they can record a message
and upload that WAV file.

# Part of Call Center App Demo

The CallCenterApp simulates a Call Center where customers call in, leave a message, that gets processed with
speech to text service from the cloud provider.  The text from the speech is populated back into Astra so that
a call center agent can review and call the customer.
